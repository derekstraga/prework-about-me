      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi Everyone! My name is Derek. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in South Jersey</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like to snowboard, play tennis and take pictures with my Nikon.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is being a software engineer for either Google or Apple, or being a traveling photographer.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I just recently relocated to right here in Somerset. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It's extremely interesting to me and a lot of fun (so far). I have built around 25 websites just using wordpress and a little CSS/HTML but wanted to jump in deeper because I enjoy it so much. My main goal is to work on developing apps and other software that can make lives easier.</p>
